/* Each time a button is clicked, it should display 2 numbers. 
   - First, the number of times it has been clicked. 
   - Second, the accumative amount all 3 buttons have been clicked. (e.g. 'I have been clicked 3 times. All 3 buttons have been clicked 10 times.')
   - Use closure to make this happen.
